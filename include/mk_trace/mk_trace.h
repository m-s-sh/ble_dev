 *  mk_trace.h - UART trace library
 *
 * 	For using mk_trace functionality:
 *	1. include this mk_trace.h file
 *	2. call once mk_trace_init(TX_BUF_SIZE, RX_BUF_SIZE);
 *	Now you are ready to use mk_trace(...) for sending diagnostic messages via UART/USB to PC
 *	Note: TX_BUF_SIZE and RX_BUF_SIZE must be power of 2
